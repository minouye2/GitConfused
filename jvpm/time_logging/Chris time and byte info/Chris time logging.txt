Chris team 3 time logging-


6:26 pm  (start) 2/23 or 2/24
-making tests in opcode branch
-switched to header info to amke tests
-added stack class for hader info
-ran into issues in general
-made a xcel doc with breakdown of the bytecodes to excpect
10:42 pm (stop) 4h 16min

2/28/19 9:27 pm start-
- call with zack 
- we made another branch
- made jvpm_methods into a class than can create an object

2/28/19 11:54 pm stop 2h 27 m

3/1/19 10:30 am start-
- made jvpm_methods a class that is instanciable
- made a test for iadd to test instance
- fixed dictionary to work with object
- pushed to test branch
- working on testing the method to get opcodes and run them
* issue - still need to be able to read opcodes from class file
- call with zack 2:15 - 2:46 -(bob should be done with opcode imprt tonight)
- added test for loop to check if it is reading bytes correctly and going through dictionaries to return methods
- also a lot of research for making objects of classes in python
3/1/19 5:13 pm stopped 6h 43m


3/2/19 9:17 am start-
- finished istore and load tets
- had to fix loop test to not use fixed variables

- still have issues with sonar cloud not working from travis
3/2/19 2:45 pm stopped  5h 28m

3/16/19 5:46 start-
-making an application to translate bytecode of constant pool

3/16/19 7:50 end

3/16/19 8:29 pm start-
finishing translator
- got the translator to go through the dictionary and start getting next values
- need to start building all the methods and append the dictionary with the new strings that are pulled
3/17/19 1:50 am end

3/17/19  10:45 am start-
-continuing to translate pool
-issues decoding byte(as string) from utf-8
-decoding finally working for utf 8- had to convert to int then to hex then decode utf8

-break - 11:26 am

- cont - 11:30 am-
-got it to append a new dictionary with corresponding strings
but am getting an extra string for some reason in slot 1
stopped -5:16



4/6/19 3:15 pm start-
- starting to refactor cool translator
- learned the difference between global variables and instance variables 3:39
- hit a block and had to draw out my problem
- end 7:30 pm


4/7/19 11:30 start-
- continuing to refactor 11:30
- team meeting
- 12:55 refactoring working but need rest of methods and getting
hex bit in front of utf8 conversion
- removed funky character in utf8 translation, so refactoring done need to build other methods 1:21
- 1:40 call ended
- added field reference and seems to be working with add two
4/7/19 1:48 end


4/7/19 6:45 pm trying to build more methods but I dont think im getting the correct constant pool for other class
aside from add two and test
4/7/19 7:05 pm

4/9/19 5:45 pm start-
- making more unit tests but dont know how get pull works
- continuing to build a new pool pulling method (just need to skip index for double and long)
- new pool reader works, going to test it on old code
4/9/19 end


4/10/19 12:42 pm start-
- working on getting to opcodes
- fixed the puller but now translator is messed up, but i am returning correct pool size now
- well reader and translator now work
- call with zack for an hour exlplaining how to get through the pool
- going to integrate to dev
- new code working need to fix tests 6:48
- fixed tests for my new code 7:38
- just need to merge it to dev
- had some merge conflicts with zack
4/10/19 -9: done

4/19/19 2:07 - testing merge to see how bad it will be but looks ok, we just need tests
